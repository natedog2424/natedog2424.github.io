Click and drag the mouse to orbit the camera. Use WASD or the arrow keys to roll the marble.

This demo was created after taking a computer graphics course at my university. I was inspired by the fun assignments and wanted to challenge myself to make a simple game from scratch instead of using a game engine like I had done before. The hardest parts of this project were the shaders and getting quaternions implemented for rotations. The shader utilizes a triplanar mapping technique for the texture mapping which was especially challenging when considering how the normal maps affected the lighting. Since I wanted the marble to roll around the maze convincingly, I needed a way to express 3D rotations without worrying about gimbal lock. I had to resort to implementing quaternions which are 4D vectors that can represent 3D rotations. The 4D nature of quaternions made grasping the concept quite challenging but ultimately I got it working satisfactorily.
